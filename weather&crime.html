        <h2 class="overview">For this Design Sprint, the overarching goal is to create a mobile platform that will help individuals, specifically freelancers & remote workers find public places that they can work from. Some of the main priorities that these individuals are looking for are places where they can take phone calls, quick meetings, and get work done quietly. In terms of the design constraints, the goal of the application is to help users find places that already exist. Additionally, there is a requirement of a monthly fee for users. </h2>

      <div class="section">
        <h1 class="research">02 User's Priorities</h1>
        <h2 class="overview1"><li>Access to wifi as most of remote work and freelancers work is done on their computers</li>
            <li>Prioritize not needing to buy something </li>
            <li>Public Place with easy access</li>
            <li>Good Connectivity</li>
            <li>Limited Crowds</li></h2>

     <h1 class="takeaways">User Insights</h1>
     <h2><li>Wondering what kind of information would be seen on the main interaction screen</li>
       <li>Believes this tool would be useful for those who work primarily on their computer</li> 
       <li>She says, as an artist, it would be interesting to have a similar concept for something that is more tailored to her - open studio space, etc.. somewhere she can work other than her own apartment</li>
       <li>Believes that the review screens could be more dynamic, feels a little elementary</li>
       <li>She says it would be interesting to have a feature that shows how busy it is a current time</li>
    </h2>

    <h1 class="takeaways">Conclusion</h1>
    <h2 class = "overview">This was my first time conducting a design sprint. It was extremely informative and useful to understand the design process and finish a project in this time period. In terms of next steps or room for iteration, I would revisit this project in order to further work on the main interaction screens as well as add more features. </h2>
